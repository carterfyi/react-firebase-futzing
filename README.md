# Hello World
Hi there, I'm Carter!

Welcome to this ancient repo of mine. As long as you're here, let me tell you how it came to be:

# Background
A long time ago, as a wee early-20-something-lad, I found myself hearing more and more chatter about this newfangled, Ã¼ber-declarative UI Library called React. That summer, I chanced upon upon a rare few days of spare time, and selected a [suitable-seeming deep-dive tutorial project](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react), and set to work on its task of a creating a GithubAPI-calling React+React-Router App, statically hosted on Firebase project. To my surprise, I was able to pick through the course & its project in 2 days, and in the end found myself completely hooked on React. (even without Hooks!)

With more spare time left than I'd anticipated I noodled around with the tutorial app for a bit, when it occurred to me: "Hey! I can build the `${esportsEventsAndMediaOrganization}` team website that I need to do anyway using React & Firebase, and get some more experience & ideas while I'm at it!"

The former intent quickly shaped up to be a more ambitious task than I could handle at the time, once accounting for my non-technical teammates' need to edit the site without me. (Solution? WordPress + [Elementor](https://elementor.com/)) Nonetheless, before abandoning this project, I was able to make good on the latter intent of gaining more valuable React (+Router) experience, and in subsequent years have augmented my React toolkit with such modern bells and whistles as Typescript, [Component Libraries](), and eventually with Hooks & their attendant functional-first approach.

# Why Keep This Repository
In the course of doing some post-quarter-life-crisis cleanup of my personal development ecosystem, I decided to revisit this repo in its humble home at the bottom of my Github repos list. I had previously archived it, and considered deleting it, but decided after all to simply tack on this README & leave it up unfinished. May it stand as a waypoint in my own programming journey, but beyond that as a monument the legions of incomplete developer side-projects everywhere; be they in archived repos, broken CodePens, un-pushed local fiddles; even office whiteboard sketches, left to dry unerased for 2+ years in all-but-abandoned tech campuses nationwide.

Lastly: however & whyever you've arrived at these words, dear reader, may it be a tribute to you as well: to your curiosity, your resourcefulness, and [whatever secret ingredient](https://youtu.be/ZGeWNR8CWnA?t=328) you happen to bring with you. While I doubt this code is it, I hope that you find what you're searching for, and that you remember be kind to yourself as you do.
